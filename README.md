# Theory of Probability v1.0

These are the scribed notes for Dr. Manuj Mukherjee's _Theory of Probability_.

### Code

The project can be compiled on a system supporting `latexmk` and `asymptote`,
with a sufficiently recent version of TeX Live.
Simply run `latexmk`.
On a system with nix, just run `nix build`.

_Pull requests are welcome!_
You can email corrections directly to me as well.
